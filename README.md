### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™ve been learning more C# (.NET 6, Unity, Blazor basics, etc.).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about procedural generation, cellular automata, emergent complexity, some low-level programming.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about generating conlangs with Python!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/logantilley/)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I like to mess around with sound design here and there. Serum, Harmor, and Sytrus are my synthesizers of choice. I use FL Studio.
